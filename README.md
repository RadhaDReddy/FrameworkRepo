TransLoc Test Automation Exercise - Radha Reddy

This is my project for test-automation of a simple feature of the Architect Application.
Technologies used : Java, Selenium, Junit, Cucumber in Eclipse.
This is my first project using Cucumber. I had to set up the Maven project for Cucumber from scratch.

This is also my first project in Github.
I had to create an account on Github, install Git on my computer and learn how to create a New Repository.

I learnt about the GTFS standard. I briefly explored the functionality of the Architect.
I chose a simple scenario to automate.
The description of the scenario is in the feeds.feature.

I am sorry I couldn't spare the time to work on a more complex scenario.

Thank you
Regards
Radha
